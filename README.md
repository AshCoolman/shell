# Shell: useful scripts for a web developer

Some handy shell scripts

## To use

* `src/run-once.sh` - install deps

## Entry points

Add to bashrc.

* `all.sh` - navigating files and folders


## On bash

Because I always forget

> .bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.

> When you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.

> But, if youâ€™ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) then .bashrc is executed before the window command prompt. .bashrc is also run when you start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.

> On OS X, Terminal by default runs a login shell every time, so this is a little different to most other systems, but you can configure that in the preferences.
